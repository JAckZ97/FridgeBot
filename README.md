## Summary
The goal of this project is to record and log the food that is added in the fridge. Every time the command is called,it will generate a list of recipes that can be prepared with the food currently in the fridge. That way, we do not have to always consider what to eat at night and get annoyed. In addition, it can also track the nutritional value of the food we are eating and how much calories we are taking. 

## Features
- Log and record the food that we bought using "Computer Vision" paired with Laptop webcam
